hoops-app
=========
Project app for a cours I'm taking in Tamkang University called "Social media apps".
Predicted to be completed in February 2014.

The easiest way to run this is to clone project and just open www/index.html in a webbrowser.
Hower, to get full use of a mobile device you must create a phonegap build (info wwww.phonegap.com) and then replace the generated "www" folder with the one in this repository.
Then run on android emulator.
